# Problem we are solving for this year Solution Challenge is - 

Due to the complete dominance of ecommerce platforms and instant goods delivery services, there are many street vendors and small businesses in India that are really struggling to draw in more customers and increase their sales. As a result of this power, these organisations control the prices and supply chain for their own financial gain.
Despite the enormous population and demand, these small and local-business owners struggle with such low exposure and demand. By bringing together local buyers and these sellers on one platform, where buyers can buy from them, our platform finds a solution to this issue. This helps small businesses flourish and fosters healthy competition in the market by eradicating the sway of dominant corporations.
